# Image-Classifier-Application

This is my first project uploaded in Github.

This project implement deep learning algorithms to help classify different species of flowers.

The first part is the CNN model that I built with PyTorch.
The second part is the command line application.

Overall, the model achieved a 93% accuracy rate on the test dataset.
